# machine-learning-course
Latif's attempt at the Machine Learning Course https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/. 
The repo contains the lecture / course notes and code. `Personal` will contain Latif's version of the same code. Will be done predominantly in `Pycharm` unless visualisation is needed in Jupyter notebook.
